**Abstract**  
A destructive earthquake of moment magnitude Mw 7.8 struck central Nepal on April 25, 2015, followed by hundreds of aftershocks. According to the preliminary report of the Department of Archaeology (DOA), Nepal, the earthquake affected as many as 745 monuments in 20 districts. Out of them, 193 monuments were completely collapsed, 95 monuments partially collapsed, and 517 monuments were partly damaged. The heritage sector in Nepal is assumed crucial for development mainly through tourism and employment generation and as a source of national pride as well. However, over three years following the Gorkha Nepal earthquake, not many of the collapsed heritage structures have been reconstructed. Several critical questions from the people and the media have emerged in this regard. The government and concerned departments have often been asked why they have not been able to undertake reconstruction faster and to do more. This paper explains the reasons behind the slow restoration process and what has been done so far in Kathmandu Valley. Ethnographic fieldwork was carried out in the seven UNESCO listed heritage sites and other heritage areas over a period of six months. This study research shows that the delay in heritage reconstruction was primarily due to the lack of a clear and well-supported policy for heritage reconstruction; conflict on construction material to be used for reconstruction; mode of contract for reconstruction; limited governance capacity; lack of manpower for traditional artwork; and the lack of a framework to support local community-driven rebuilding initiatives. Some recommendations are made to accelerate the reconstruction of heritage structures in Kathmandu Valley.
