**Abstract**  
This paper reports the structural failures and collapse of heritage structures in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, during the 2015 Nepal earthquake, and presents preliminary findings regarding the causes of failures and collapses. Field reconnaissance was carried out immediately after the main shock (Mw 7.8) on April 25 and the strongest aftershock (Mw 7.3) on May 12. It was observed that the performance of heritage structures was influenced by the combination of several factors, including structural and architecture type, configuration and structural deficiency, local site effects and ground-motion characteristics, age and maintenance level, material quality, etc. It was observed that dome structures performed very well, followed by pagoda (tiered temple), and shikhara structures were found as the most vulnerable structures. Moreover, it was observed that structures that had been seismically retrofitted and well maintained appeared to perform well. Some recommendations are made to improve the seismic performance of the heritage structures in Kathmandu Valley.
