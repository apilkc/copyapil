**Abstract**
The 2019 windstorm in Nepal struck villages in the Bara and Parsa districts, central-south of Nepal, on March 31, 2019, causing widespread devastation. The storm, rated five (5) on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, cut a 33 km swath through central-southern Nepal. In total, 1,452 private houses were destroyed, while 1,373 others suffered partial damage. The tragic storm claimed 28 lives and left 1,155 individuals injured. The impact of this tragedy extended to nearly 3,000 families. Immediately after the storm, a comprehensive damage assessment framework was developed, and a field reconnaissance study was conducted to understand the damage distribution and building failure mechanisms under tornado wind loads. Common damage modes observed were roofing material damage, roof-to-wall connection failure, and brittle masonry wall failures in the affected areas. This paper presents the lessons learned from damage to the building infrastructure during the 2019 windstorm in Nepal. Examined buildings underscore the critical need for design alternatives and sustainable retrofits, emphasizing load path integration and strong roof-to-wall connection. Strengthening the building envelope can significantly enhance its resilience against storms and other disasters prominent in the region. This study highlights the importance of proactive measures to safeguard vulnerable communities against natural hazards and offers insights into resilient building construction technology.
