**Abstract**  
A destructive earthquake of moment magnitude Mw 7.8 struck central Nepal on April 25, 2015, followed by hundreds of aftershocks. A preliminary report of the Department of Archaeology (DOA), Nepal, suggested that as many as 745 monuments in 20 districts were affected. The heritage structures are crucial sectors for development, mainly through tourism and employment generation. However, over three years following the Gorkha Nepal earthquake, many collapsed heritage structures were not reconstructed. This paper explores the progress of heritage reconstruction in Kathmandu Valley along with the reasons behind the slow reconstruction process. Ethnographic fieldwork was carried out in the seven UNESCO listed heritage sites and other heritage areas over six months from November 2019 to April 2020. The research shows that the delay in heritage reconstruction was primarily due to the lack of a well-defined policy for heritage reconstruction; conflict on construction materials to be used for reconstruction; procurement modality for reconstruction; limited governance capacity; lack of workforce for traditional artwork; and the lack of a framework to support community-driven rebuilding initiatives. Some recommendations are made to accelerate the reconstruction of heritage structures in Kathmandu Valley.
